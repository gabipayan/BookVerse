# 📚 BookVerse

BookVerse is a full-stack book search engine that allows users to discover new books using the Google Books API, save their favorite finds, and manage their personal reading list. Originally built with a RESTful API, it has been fully refactored to use **GraphQL** with **Apollo Server**, offering a more efficient and flexible way to fetch and modify data.

> Deployed on [Render]([https://render.com/](https://bookverse-1-ocad.onrender.com)) with a MongoDB Atlas cloud database.
